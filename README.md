Hi.

If you are looking to run the UFT test script, you will need to install the HP UFT (previously known as Mercury QTP) software,
from http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/software-solutions/unified-functional-automated-testing/

The UFT install files are unfortunately > 3GB in size, but the tool is a good one (depending on the Application Under Test), 
and free for evaluation use for 60 days

If however the vb script (with some explanatory comments) along with the results of execution, are sufficient for your initial review of my approach, 
these are the files within Valtech_Website_01_ForSubmission directory named:

Valtech_Website_01_ForSubmission\Action1\Script.mts

and

Valtech_Website_01_ForSubmission\Res1\Report\run_results.html

I would be happy to discuss my approach, and my willingness to perform similar tests in either Microsofts Coded UI Test, or Selenium.

I happened to have UFT installed and ready to go on my Laptop, as it was the tool of choice at the DWP.

If you have any queries about my tests, please don't hesitate to either ask the agent or call me directly on 0779 292 3638.

Regards,

Kevin.
